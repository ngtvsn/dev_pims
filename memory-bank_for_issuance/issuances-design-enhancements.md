# Issuances Module Design Enhancements

This document details the specific design and UI improvements made to the Issuances module. These changes were implemented as part of the first phase of the enhancement roadmap.

## 1. Collapsible Filter Panel

The original static "Filter Options" card has been replaced with a more dynamic, collapsible panel.

- **Component:** The standard Bootstrap card component was enhanced with the `card-primary` and `card-outline` classes to provide better visual distinction.
- **Functionality:** A collapse button, powered by Bootstrap's `data-card-widget="collapse"` attribute, was added to the card header. This allows users to show or hide the filter controls, saving screen space when not in use.
- **Layout:** Each filter control (dropdowns and search bar) was wrapped in a `div` with the `form-group` class. This ensures consistent spacing and alignment of the form elements, following Bootstrap best practices.

## 2. Fixed Table Header

A "sticky" table header was implemented to improve the user experience when scrolling through long lists of issuances.

- **CSS:** A custom CSS class, `.fixed-header`, was added to the `issuances/index.blade.php` file. This class uses `position: sticky` and a `z-index` to ensure the header remains fixed at the top of the viewport during vertical scrolling.
- **JavaScript:** A jQuery script was added to dynamically apply and remove the `.fixed-header` class based on the user's scroll position relative to the table header's original offset. This ensures the sticky behavior is only active when needed.

These enhancements provide a cleaner, more modern, and user-friendly interface for the Issuances module without altering the core functionality.
