# Active Context

## Current Focus

The primary focus is on enhancing the user interface and experience of the "Issuances" module. This includes replacing the existing date picker with native browser controls and implementing a more robust solution for selecting document recipients.

## Recent Changes

- **Date Picker Refactoring:** The Flatpickr implementation in the Issuances module has been completely replaced with native HTML5 `input type="date"` elements. This simplifies the frontend by removing the Flatpickr library dependency and the associated custom JavaScript and CSS.
- **UI Layout Adjustments:**
    - The "Search (by Title)" input field in the filter options has been converted to a `textarea` for better usability with longer search queries.
    - The "Show Entries" dropdown has been repositioned to appear next to the "List of Issuances" title for a more intuitive layout.

## Next Steps

- **Implement Multiselect for Recipients:** The next major enhancement is to replace the `textarea` for recipients in the upload modal with a dynamic, searchable multiselect component (e.g., using Select2). This will be populated with data from the `document_recipients` table via a new API endpoint.
- **Address Technical Debt:** Continue to address the known technical debt issues listed in `progress.md`, such as replacing abandoned packages.
