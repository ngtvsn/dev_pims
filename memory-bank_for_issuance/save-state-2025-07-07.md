# Save State: 2025-07-07

This document captures the state of the PITAHC DEVPIMS project at the end of the development session on July 7, 2025. It is intended to be used as a reference and a starting point for future work.

## I. Module: Issuances

The primary focus of this development cycle was the creation and refinement of the Administrative Issuances module.

### 1. Core Functionality

- **Data Source:** The module is powered by the `documents` table in the database.
- **Backend Logic:** The `IssuanceController` handles all backend logic, including server-side processing for the data table.
- **Data Seeding:** The `DocumentSeeder` is used to populate the database with dummy data for testing and development.

### 2. User Interface (UI)

- **Layout:** The page is structured in a two-column layout, with filter controls on the left and the main data table on the right.
- **Filtering:** A collapsible "Filter Options" card provides controls for filtering by issuance category, a search bar, and a "show entries" dropdown.
- **Data Table:** The table of issuances is powered by the DataTables.net library and features:
    - Server-side processing for efficient handling of large datasets.
    - A custom-rendered "Subject" column that is a clickable link to the issuance PDF and includes the issuance type and date posted.
    - A "Document Date" column.
    - An "Actions" column with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
    - Centered, "simple" pagination (Previous/Next only) with custom styling.

### 3. Key Files

- **Controller:** `app/Http/Controllers/IssuanceController.php`
- **View:** `resources/views/issuances/index.blade.php`
- **Route:** `routes/web.php` (defines the `/issuances` and `/issuances/data` routes)
- **Migration:** `database/migrations/2025_07_07_134500_add_file_path_to_documents_table.php`
- **Seeder:** `database/seeders/DocumentSeeder.php`

## II. Project-Wide Changes

- **Dependencies:** The `yajra/laravel-datatables-buttons` package was installed to provide DataTables functionality.
- **Configuration:** The `config/app.php` file was updated to include the `DataTables` service provider and facade.
- **Middleware:** The abandoned `Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors` middleware was replaced with the official `Illuminate\Http\Middleware\HandleCors` middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- **Layout:** A missing jQuery dependency was added to the main application layout file, `resources/views/layouts/b_app.blade.php`.

## III. How to Replicate This State

1.  Ensure all files in the project match the current state in the repository.
2.  Run `composer install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date.
3.  Run `php artisan migrate` to apply all database migrations.
4.  Run `php artisan db:seed` to populate the database with the latest dummy data.
5.  Run `php artisan config:cache` to ensure the application configuration is up to date.
