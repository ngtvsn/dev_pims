# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a front-end document issuance page that allows users to filter and view document issuances through a dual-card interface. The left card provides filtering capabilities while the right card displays the filtered results in a data table format.

3. IF no module type is selected THEN the system SHALL show all document types in results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for documents using text and issuance numbers, so that I can quickly find specific documents.

4. IF invalid date range is entered (from > to) THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear all filters and search for filtered results, so that I can reset my search or apply my current filter criteria.
